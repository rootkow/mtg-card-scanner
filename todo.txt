Necessary todos:
- Card segmentation
    > Look into MobileSAM: https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM
- OCR segmented sections
    > ie. Name, type, oracle text, flavor, artist, etc.
- Classification
    > Set symbol
- Scryfall integration for card details
    - Pull bulk JSON DB

Functional/UX considerations:
- Option to show a box on screen for optimal positioning
- Persistance (DB)
    > Cards, settings export/backup
- Fallbacks after X unit_time if unable to determine card within % confidence
- TCGplayer, Card Kingdom, etc. integrations (pricing)
- *** Localization ***
- Option for fuzzy searching?

Feature considerations:
- *** Ultimately the idea is to build something generic enough to be used for any CCG. Ideally without needing to retrain a model for future CCGs. ***
- Cloud sync for app backup (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Deck building from collection
    > Moxfield (or some deck building tool) integration
- Does MTG Stocks have any integration APIs that'd be useful?
    > ie. historical information? (their data might just be from TCGplayer, not sure)
- Graded card info
    > PSA, BGS, Ebay vault?, etc integration
- Mode determine rough card condition
- Open the sports cards can of worms. Pandoras box will eventually be open...
